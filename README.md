# SpotiPass

StreetSpot (formerly SpotiPass), a blend of Spotify and Nintendo's StreetPass, offers a unique way to discover and connect with other music enthusiasts. By leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), StreetSpot allows users to seamlessly share their musical tastes with others they pass by.

## How It Works

Users create a StreetSpot profile by securely signing into their Spotify account. As they go about their day, the app uses BLE to find other SpotiPass users in close proximity. When a connection is made, users can discover each other's Spotify profiles, including their top albums, favorite songs, and total listening hours.
